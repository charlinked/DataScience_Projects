# DataScience_Projects
Collection of Data Science projects demonstrating webscraping, data munging, EDA & insights, machine learning & prediction models + how to gain business insights from machine learning models.

Projects in this folder:
1. *4dynamicwebscrapers* : In this project I'm demonstrating 4 different techniques that can be used to scrape websites with dynamic content. I'm using Beautiful Soup, Selenium and different web drivers (such as headless and pyqt5) 
2. *predicting conversion rates*: In this project I'm using a RandomForrest classifier to predict if a customer on an e-commerce website will 'convert' and make a purchase. Using permutation importance and Shapley (SHAP) values I'm getting insights into what is driving the conversion rate, and what the company can do to imporve their conversion rate and get more customers to make a purchase.
3. *top 100 companies* : this project demonstrates how to use Beautiful soup to scrape data from a webpage and how to perform data munging on scraped data. I'm also using Seaborn to demonstrate some of its functionalities and gain insights on the top 100 companies of 2019
